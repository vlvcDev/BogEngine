# BogEngine
This is a 3D rendering engine made with DirectX11. This project is being developed to explore and understand the intricacies and simplifications that modern game development engines do to make their software. So far it can do:
- Render and transform objects with vertex and face data
- import OBJ files
- Camera movement
<br>What I want to add/improve:
- Add a level, likely just a plane to walk on
- Add a skybox
- Optimize rendering objects with a vision cone
- Make a vision distance for the player
- Add enemies and simple melee combat
- Add a scoring system
- Better camera movement, right now rotating the camera back and forth feels janky, as if smoothed
